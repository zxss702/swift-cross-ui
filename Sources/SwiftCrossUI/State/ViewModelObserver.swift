///
/// The most important rule: Every computation of a view's `body` MUST be performed inside a call to
/// `observe()`. For example:
///
///     let body = self.observe(in: backend) { view.body }
///     // Use `body`
///
/// Then, `viewModelDidChange()` will automatically be called the next time a view model conforming
/// to `Observable` or `Perceptible` and used inside the `body` computation will have change.
///
/// - Important: `self` MUST only be used to observe a single view because
/// `viewModelDidChange()` will only be called for the most recent call to `observe()` in order to
/// prevent duplicate view updates.
