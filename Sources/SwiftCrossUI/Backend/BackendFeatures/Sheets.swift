        ///   - size: The size of the sheet.

        ///     the user. Not triggered by programmatic dismissals, but _is_
        ///     triggered by the implicit dismissals of nested sheets when their
        ///     parent sheet is programmatically dismissed.

        ///     macOS doesn't support custom window corner radii).
        ///   - detents: An array of sizes that the sheet should snap to. This is
        ///     generally only a thing on mobile where sheets can be dragged up

        ///     `nil`, the platform's default sheet background style should be used.

        ///     dismissal. On mobile this disables swiping to dismiss a sheet, and
        ///     on desktop this usually disables dismissal shortcuts such as the
