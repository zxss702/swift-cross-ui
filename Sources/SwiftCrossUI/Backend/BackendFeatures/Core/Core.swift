    /// - ``GenericContainers``

        /// Creates an instance of the backend.

        ///
        /// This is used to determine text sizing and other adaptive properties.
        var deviceClass: DeviceClass { get }

        /// Runs the backend's main run loop.
        ///
        /// The app will exit when this method returns. This will always be the
        /// first method called by SwiftCrossUI.
        ///
        /// Often in UI frameworks (such as Gtk), code is run in a callback
        /// after starting the app, and hence this generic root window creation
        /// API must reflect that. This is always the first method to be called
        /// and is where boilerplate app setup should happen.
        ///
        /// The callback is where SwiftCrossUI will create windows, render
        /// initial views, start state handlers, etc. The setup action must be
        /// run exactly once. The backend must be fully functional before the
        /// callback is ready.
        ///
        /// It is up to the backend to decide whether the callback runs before or
        /// after the main loop starts. For example, some backends (such as
        /// `AppKitBackend`) can create windows and widgets before the run loop
        /// starts, so it makes the most sense to run the setup before the main run
        /// loop starts (it's also not possible to run the setup function once the
        /// main run loop starts anyway). On the other side is `GtkBackend` which
        /// must be on the main loop to create windows and widgets (because
        /// otherwise the root window has not yet been created, which is essential
        /// in Gtk), so the setup function is passed to `Gtk` as a callback to run
        /// once the main run loop starts.
